# YePhIcK's Fun Side Projects

This repository is a collection of my personal side projects — experiments, prototypes, and random coding adventures.  
They range from **World of Warcraft addons** to **embedded C++ utilities**, small **HTML/JS apps**, and other ideas I feel like building.

The purpose of this repo is to share my tinkering and make it easy for others to browse, learn, or reuse pieces of code.

## Structure

Each project lives in its own subdirectory. Some examples include:

- **WoW-Addons/**
  - `ATT-GoGo` — a companion addon for [All The Things (ATT)](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings), adding a dungeon/raid progress grid.
- **Embedded/**
  - Experiments and utilities for Cypress FX3 / FX20 and other embedded platforms.
- **WebApps/**
  - Small browser-based tools, demos, and experiments.

(Expect this list to grow over time!)
